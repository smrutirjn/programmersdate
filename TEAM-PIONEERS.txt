PROJECT DESCRIPTION-
So we all know that in this critical situation of corona where it is difficult for the administartion to track the
health condition of so many patients, it is a high time to make hospital management automated as the number of patients
are increasing day by day. it is also difficult for the people to go and consult the doctors. so we propose to develop
a web app HOSPITALLY where a user can find all the nearby hospitals in his area and also can check the doctor's a
availability from the list of the hospitals and can also track the total number of beds available in that hospital.
HOSPITALLY also comes with a telegram integrated chatbot that let's the user know about all the details about COVID-19 
.It also has a section for hospital management where they can login and track the bed available in their hospitals
and record the patient health conditions. WE also have an IOT based smart saline monitoring system where an alert 
can be sent to the hospital managemnt if the saline level goes down so that it won't be any need to regularly check
the saline status of a patient and the system is made fully automated.

TECHNOLOGY STACK USED-
Bubble.io(for web app development)
Arduino IDE(for IOT based smart bottle for saline monitoring)
Firebase(for getting realtime database of saline status)
Google Dialogflow(for making chatbot)
